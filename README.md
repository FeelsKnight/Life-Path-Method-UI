# What is this?

This is an application designed to automatically create characters for Dungeons and Dragons 5E using /u/hornbook1776's
Life Path Method. Among other things, this program allows you to specify your desired race and starting life path,
generate new characters in a click of a mouse and see attribute scores and recommended classes in real time. It also
allows you to export a character's information in .txt format.

# What are all these options?

# Race

You can choose one of the available race options. This race will be displayed in the output text, and its attribute bonuses
will be accounted for. The Random option will randomly choose one of the other options for you.

# Gender

You can choose one of the available gender options. This gender will be displayed in the output text, but will not affect
your attributes whatsoever. The Random option will randomly choose one of the other options for you,
with Non-binary being rarer than the others.

# Path

You can choose one of the available path options. The paths contain different events corresponding to their theme.
The Random option will randomly choose one of the other options for you.

# Number of events

You can enter a number of events you wish to have happened to your character, from 0 to 250. Usually, one event is
equivalent to one month in your character’s life. 12 is the recommended number. Numbers 12 through 14 produce
characters with balanced stats most of the time. You can add another event after generating your character by
clicking the “Roll for another event” button

# Attribute bonuses

You can choose one of the available attribute bonuses display options. If Shown is chosen, each line will display
attribute bonuses at its end, e.g. “You are smart! INT +1” If Hidden is chosen, the lines will not display its attribute
bonuses, e.g. “You are smart!”

# Generate button

Generates a new character according to the options chosen above. If you already have a character displayed, erases
that character first, but keeps the options.

# What now?

# Results: events, recommended classes and attributes

Displays the events and corresponding attributes generated with the life path method, and recommended classes (These
are chosen according to multiclassing requirements. You can choose a class even if it is not displayed, and even if none
are displayed). Also displays an evaluation of your attribute total relative to average scores.

# Roll for another event button

Adds another event to your history and changes your attributes and recommended classes accordingly.

# Scratch this character button

Clears all results.

# Import this character to .txt button

Creates a .txt file named Life Path Method [current date and time].txt and exports current character's information to it.
